When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you want to share your code with others and when you would like to backup your files

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Similarly with git allowing you to choose when to commit, pulling changes manually allows you power to only share commits which are ready to become public
