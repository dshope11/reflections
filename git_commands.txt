git init

git clone

git checkout
git checkout master
git checkout -b new_branch_name
	note: Equivalent to 'git branch new_branch_name' followed by 'git checkout new_branch_name'. Since these are the commands you would use to make and switch to a new branch, it's nice that there is a one line version. This is also the command you would run if you were in a detached head state, made a new commit, and wanted to retain changes
